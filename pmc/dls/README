This is where any DLS standard pmc files live.

Contents:
Standard PLCs (like encoder loss)
Co-ordinate system definitions and PLCs that aren't too specialist
Standard I variable definitions

Restrictions:
PLCxx should only use P variables Pxx00-Pxx99
P101..132 and P301..332 are reserved for Mres and offset reporting
Coordinate systems should use Q variables instead
PLC16-PLC31 are reserved for position reporting for CS1-16
Please uses unique timers for each PLC, 
Here is a useful #define statement for this:
#define timer i(5111+($(PLC)&30)*50+$(PLC)%2)
E.g.
if $(PLC)=0 defines timer=i5111
if $(PLC)=1 defines timer=i5112
if $(PLC)=2 defines timer=i5211
if $(PLC)=3 defines timer=i5212
if $(PLC)=4 defines timer=i5311, etc.

Building pmc files:
Using a series of #includes and #defines you can build a pmc file up using some
of the standard files in this directory. It is recommended that you use 
dls-pmc-preprocessor.py to expand the #includes before downloading to the pmac. 
To do this, you will need to add the following to your src/Makefile:

DATA += Example_processed.pmc

%_processed.pmc: ../%.pmc
	dls-pmc-preprocessor.py -c -o $@ -I ..:$(TPMAC)/data $<
	
Look at Example.pmc for more details
