This is a TCL/TK based GUI to call all PMAC-related MEDM screens. The
example corresponds to the GM/CA 23ID beamline at the APS.

Usage:           ./23ID.tcl

One has to modify the config23ID.tcl file according to the names
of loaded PMAC-related databases (see the iocBoot directories).

Also file config.tcl has to be updated with the locations of
external programs like medm and xterm (in the attached version
everything is assumed to be in the system path).
