These are transformation subroutines working with TSUB record. The aim of
TSUB is to take some values stored in "input" databases, perfom a
transformation according to respective transformation subroutine and record
the output valuies into some "output" databases. Each TSUB record must have
a related subroutine specified in the SNAM field.

A typical use of TSUB records with PMAC is to map from e.g. actual motors
positions into axis positions or from requested axis mosition into requested
motor position. For example, when one specifies desired monochromator energy,
a TSUB record and the associated subroutine tsubMOEnAxs (see tsubMO.c) are
used to map the value into desired monochromator rotary and monochromator
second crystal translation positions.

The transformation routines in this directory are grouped as one file per
assembly type. So, when one adds a new PMAC motors assembly type (e.g. an
XYZ translation stage), he has to write a new tsubXYZ.c file by analogy
with other assemblies.
